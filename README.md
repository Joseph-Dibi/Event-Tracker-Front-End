## Event Tracker

  This project was designed to merge with the Java backend that I had created earlier in the program. The project works by having services that call to the Java back-end portion. The Angular side takes the data returned from running those RESTful controller routes and places it into the HTML to be presented in a useful way to the user.

## User Function

  The user is able to add runs with their distance, time, week, and description. They are able to update/delete this information when viewing the details of a single run. The user is able to view their total/average run distance and time. They are also able to sort their runs by week and view total/average for the week. This data is aggregated in the Java backend.
